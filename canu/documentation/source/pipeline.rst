Canu Pipeline
=============

The pipeline is described in Koren S, Walenz BP, Berlin K, Miller JR, Phillippy AM. `Canu: scalable and accurate long-read assembly via adaptive k-mer weighting and repeat separation <http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/08/24/071282>`_. bioRxiv. (2016).
Figure 1 of the paper shows the primary pipeline (below, top) and the supplement contains the sub-pipeline for building read and overlap databases (below, bottom).
